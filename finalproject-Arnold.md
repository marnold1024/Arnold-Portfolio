# Final Project- (My driving mileage)

## Part 1: A Project Proposal

### Outline
#### Summary: 
I'm interested in how much I drive per month and how that relates to others around Pittsburgh, the US, and even the world. I'm also interested in how my driving affects my life, as well as others. My hope is the results will allow me to become aware of the side effects of driving, and make lifestyle changes according to the results.

#### Structure:
I will start my story with an introduction to my driving and transportation habits. My original data of my mileage per month will also be introduced in the beginning so it can be used throughout the rest of the story. 
Next, I will compare my driving data with other averages within the city of Pittsburgh and then more broadly; throughout the United States and the world. (This section may be included in my first intro section, or by itself, I am not sure yet). I will included my analysis of this data in the section.
I then want to look at how my driving affects my life (and more so my wallet). I will determine the average amount of money I spend on gas each month by using the average gas prices in Pittsburgh per month. If I am able to find my actual spendings on gas, I will use that instead. I will also take into account maintenance done on my car. I will include my analysis of this data in the section.
My next section will focus on the externalities of my driving. This include determining how much emissions my car is producing as well as my carbon footprint. Other variables may be decided to be evaluated as my research progresses. These results will also be compared to the average driver (in Pittsburgh). I will include an analysis of this data in the seciton. 
My final section will be a wrap up and conclusion. Using all of the data and analyses, I will conclude how my driving affects my life as well as those around me. I will also present any changes I am choosing to make to my driving habits because of these conclusions. Finally, I will encourage others to do the same.


### Initial Sketches
Visualizations I'm going to use include charts to show my monthly mileage, comparisons between my mileage data with different populations, and pictures to show and compare my carbon footprint with the average. Examples of such visualizations are included below:
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="3ae12970-3c23-4e84-99c1-3e9975490857" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/3ae12970-3c23-4e84-99c1-3e9975490857" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>


### The Data
Data for my personal mileage is recorded by my car and obtained through the My Chevrolet website and monthly report emails. Since it is my data, I've created a Google Doc that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HlDeCGSKzjlPFpTDfFBU9jw9I9All_1-k6rCa-5f5E/edit?usp=sharing 
One data sound I found for comparing my mileage with others is: o	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-typical-commutes-for-every-big-metro-area-2015-03-25
I will use this carbon footprint calculator to determine my driving carbon footprint: https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx 
Information about greenhouse gas emissions: https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100U8YT.pdf 
Average annual miles per year: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm



### Method and Medium
I plan on completing my final project using Shorthand. My use of Shorthand will follow my structure section, where I will lead my audience through the discovery of my data. Descriptions and stories will be both provided through words and visuals for all parts. These parts include the intro of my data, introducing the local and larger averages of monthly mileages, and then my comparison with those. The price of my driving for myself (price of gas and maintenance) will be determined and depicted. I will then follow the same structure to look at outside effects of my driving, which inlcudes emissions.


## Part 2- Storyboards and User Research

### User Research Protocol
**Target Audience**- The target audience of my final project is specifically more focused toward individuals around my age that drive/own a car, but could also be more broad to include all people who drive cars. In general it could be taken even broader, and could be any adult (even if they don’t dive a car), as the topic and information is general enough that there shouldn’t be any barriers to understanding the topic. The audience could easily find a different habit/aspect of their life to relate this to. A main focus of my project is to just become more aware of our actions and their effects on ourselves, as well as those around us.

**My approach to identifying individuals to interview**- I plan on asking individuals of around my age. While I would like the majority to drive a car, I would also be interested in interviewing a person who does not drive a car, to see how they react to the project.

**Interview Script**
	Me- Hello. I’m creating a data visualization report as my final project for a course I’m taking for my Master of Public Management degree. The topic of my report is my driving mileage data and how it relates to various factors. I do not want to give it all away, as that is why you are here. I’m asking you to please look over my storyboards which outline my project and answer these few questions:
1. Do you agree with the theme? If not, what theme seems to stand out more?
2. Did the information/story flow fluidly? What, if any, changes would you make?
3. The same graphs do not yet provide all of the data, but do they seem to make sense for what they are going to show? Any suggestions?
4. How did you feel after reading this?
