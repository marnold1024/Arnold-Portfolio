# Final Project- Shifting Gears (My driving and its various impacts)

## Part 1: A Project Proposal

### Outline
#### Summary: 
I'm interested in how much I drive per month and how that relates to others around Pittsburgh, the US, and even the world. I'm also interested in how my driving affects my life, as well as others. My hope is the results will allow me to become aware of the side effects of driving, and make lifestyle changes according to the results.


#### Structure:
I will start my story with an introduction to my driving and transportation habits. My original data of my mileage per month will also be introduced in the beginning so it can be used throughout the rest of the story. 
Next, I will compare my driving data with other averages within the city of Pittsburgh and then more broadly; throughout the United States and the world. (This section may be included in my first intro section, or by itself, I am not sure yet). I will included my analysis of this data in the section.
I then want to look at how my driving affects my life (and more so my wallet). I will determine the average amount of money I spend on gas each month by using the average gas prices in Pittsburgh per month. If I am able to find my actual spendings on gas, I will use that instead. I will also take into account maintenance done on my car. I will include my analysis of this data in the section.
My next section will focus on the externalities of my driving. This include determining how much emissions my car is producing as well as my carbon footprint. Other variables may be decided to be evaluated as my research progresses. These results will also be compared to the average driver (in Pittsburgh). I will include an analysis of this data in the seciton. 
My final section will be a wrap up and conclusion. Using all of the data and analyses, I will conclude how my driving affects my life as well as those around me. I will also present any changes I am choosing to make to my driving habits because of these conclusions. Finally, I will encourage others to do the same.


### Initial Sketches
Visualizations I'm going to use include charts to show my monthly mileage, comparisons between my mileage data with different populations, and pictures to show and compare my carbon footprint with the average. Examples of such visualizations are included below:
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="e0c27e7f-5657-4f11-ba37-a03a54a5b31f" data-type="interactive" data-title="Untitled infographic"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/e0c27e7f-5657-4f11-ba37-a03a54a5b31f" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Untitled infographic</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

### The Data
Data I will use for my projet includes data my driving mileage data recorded by my car and stored on the My Chevrolet website. Driving mileage averages for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the US will be used. Other data will include national and local air quality measures. A carbon footprint calcluator will also be used to determine the amount of emissions my driving releases into the atmosphere.
My Chevrolet driving data- Since it is my data, I've downloaded it from the website and created a Google Doc that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HlDeCGSKzjlPFpTDfFBU9jw9I9All_1-k6rCa-5f5E/edit?usp=sharing 
Driving averages: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/onh2p11.htm


### Method and Medium
I plan on completing my final project using Shorthand. My use of Shorthand will follow my structure section, where I will lead my audience through the discovery of my data. Descriptions and stories will be both provided through words and visuals for all parts. These parts include the intro of my data, introducing the local and larger averages of monthly mileages, and then my comparison with those. The price of my driving for myself (price of gas and maintenance) will be determined and depicted. I will then follow the same structure to look at outside effects of my driving, which inlcudes emissions.


## Part 2- Storyboards and User Research

### User Research Protocol
**Target Audience**- The target audience of my final project is specifically more focused toward individuals around my age that drive/own a car, but could also be more broad to include all people who are concerned about air quality and its health effects. If the audience does not own a car or drive, they could easily find a different habit/aspect of their life to compare my information and outcomes to. A main focus of my project is to just become more aware of our actions and how they contribute to air pollution and affect their own lives as well as others'. 


**My approach to identifying individuals to interview**- I plan on asking individuals of around my age. While I would like the majority to drive a car, I would also be interested in interviewing a person who does not drive a car, to see how they react to the project.


**Interview Script**
	Me- Hello. I’m creating a data visualization report as my final project for a course I’m taking for my Master of Public Management degree. The topic of my report is my driving mileage data and how it relates to various factors. I do not want to give it all away, as that is why you are here. I’m asking you to please look over my storyboards which outline my project and answer these few questions:
1. Do you agree with the theme? If not, what theme seems to stand out more?
2. Did the information/story flow fluidly? What, if any, changes would you make?
3. The same graphs do not yet provide all of the data, but do they seem to make sense for what they are going to show? Any suggestions?
4. How did you feel after reading this?

### Storyboard
![storyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52502836/62244926-729bb800-b3ae-11e9-87a2-8626a17f178e.JPG)


### Graphs
I showed the graphs that are provided in my Part 1 Project assignment above. 


### Results
I interviewed three people, all within the 25-35 age range. Their answers provided similar thoughts and recommendations, as summarized below.
1. Everyone agreed with the theme and that is was apparent it was about driving statistics. One liked that I was looking at the cost of driving in a holistic way- both monetary with gas expenses and externalities with carbon emissions. Another person suggested to have a more initial focus on the rising carbon emissions and other externalities driving causes as a way to bring in the reader, and then dive into my own statisitics as a way to determine my impact on those externalities. 
2. The general consensus was that the flow of information and slides was fluid and made sense. One suggestion was to also provide more comparison between different mode of transportation with their emissions.
3. There were many great suggestions about my sample graphs. While the graphs provided some real data, not all data was provided, which may have been confusing at first. Getting the gist of the type of graph seemed useful though. Some suggestions included expanded my comparison set to Allegheny County and not just Pittsburgh. Lack or availability of public transportation was also an interest of those I interviewed. Some chart color concerns and chart choices were also provided to me.
4. I got a variety of ways my storyboard made my interviewees feel. One was happy I was using data to make informed future decisions and wishes more people would reflect on how their decisions affect themselves and others. Another would like a little more information after I get my results and make my decision of how I will change my driving habits. If I choose to drive less, it was suggested to explain why that might not be an option all the time (why I might still have to drive at certain times over others) as well as other times where I could cut down or use multiple modes of transportation.


### Changes
Based on the results of my interviews, Ive decided to make a few changes to my project. One change included an additional "box" to my storyboard. A popular question and suggestion was to add a comparison between driving and other modes of transportation. Seeing the different between money spent on different transportations as well as time spent is what I will add. Below is the additional storyboard square.
![storyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52502836/62262698-a47d4080-b3e7-11e9-82fc-be7fcf6edfd7.JPG)

I will also make a couple changes to the graphs based on suggestions. Making my mileage chart more of a comparison bar graph was a suggested addition, to be able to see how many miles I drove in May 2018 compared to May 2019. I will also consider different colors for graphs as well as possibly a different way to display my carbon footprint, depending on my results. Finally, a pictorial or stacked bar graph was a discussion with one interviewee of how I could display my money spent per month.

As I continued to worked, I realized my focus was turning more toward the environmental focus and not just looking at my driving data. This caused me to decided to eliminate the areas about comparing my money spent, in order to keep the focus on how my driving contributes to the air quality and emission of greenhouse gases.


### Final Data Story
The intended audience stayed around the focus of individuals who drive a car. It could also include those who are concerned about greenhouse gases and the air quality. Since I live in Pittsburgh, I would say the focus did turn from anyone to more specifically Pittsburgh residents. I made my project work for my audience by including comparisons of Pittsburgh with Pennsylvania and the US as a whole. While I think anyone could still relate to and enjoy my project, having the connection of living in or knowing about Pittsburgh would add to it. 

After considering and processesing my user research feedback, I did change my focus slightly for my final project. I decided to focus my data around the fact that Pittsburgh's air quality is exceeding the national standard and how my driving is impacting that. While still focusing on myself but twisting it toward the environment and air quality, I hope to attract a wider audience and bring more interest to the topic. This allows others to evaluate their daily activities as well and see how they are impacting the world around them.

Going from the storyboards and wireframes to creating the actual project in Shorthand was both an easy transition, but somewhat difficult. Knowing the flow my story was going to follow helped with choosing the design, but learning the actual tool (Shorthand) took some time. I chose to separate the sections of my storyboard with "title" sections with a picture background to break up the text and graphs of each section. The design of each section changed slightly, so it was nice to have the "title" sections to break those up to allow for transitions and readability of each section. Deciding which format to display the charts and graphs was a challenge, partially due to the design restrictions of Shorthand. I would have liked to embed my visualization into Shorthand but include a text description right next to it, but not having a coding backround, I could not find an easy way to do so. I instead then chose to take images of my visualizations so they could have text next to them. While this fixed the problem, the images were then smaller than I preferred and not interactive.

Overall I enjoyed this final project. It was interesting to take something I do everyday, driving, and look at it a different way. I know my driving every day puts miles on the car and emits gas, but I never looked at the numerical numbers before. While I am happy to have found out that I am below the averages of driving mileage and carbon footprint, that does not mean I am not concerned with changing my habits at all. Considering Pittsburgh received an F in all three air quality categories, I am now more aware of how my daily activities are affecting my life and those around me by contributing to greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmostphere. If we want to help our city decrease those levels, we all have to be conscious and aware of our actions.
