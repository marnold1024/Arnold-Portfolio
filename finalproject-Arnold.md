# Final Project- (My driving mileage)

## Part 1: A Project Proposal

### Outline
#### Summary: 
I'm interested in how much I drive per month and how that relates to others around Pittsburgh, the US, and even the world. I'm also interested in how my driving affects my life, as well as others.

#### Structure:

This will be determined by calculating the money I spend on gas and maintenance, how much emissions my car is extracting and my carbon footprint, as well as other possible variables. I will also compare these results to the average driver in Pittsburgh.
