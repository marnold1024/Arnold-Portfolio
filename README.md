# Arnold-Portfolio
This portfolio will hold my work for my Telling Stories with Data course.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Megan (pronouns: she, her). I'm in my second semester of the Master of Public Management program and am hoping to graduate in 2021. 
I currently work for CMU at the Software Engineering Institute. I'm part of the Transition Services team, assisting with the course administration and logistics of the professional development courses offered on software architecture and insider threat to our internal and external clients locally and internationally. While my future after graduation is unclear, I hope to either still be employed by CMU or get a job at a nonprofit focusing on community development.

## What I hope to learn
I'm very excited about this course, as it is the first of this kind for me, so I know I will get a lot out of it. I'm interested in being able to show data in a visually pleasing and effective manner. I'm also excited to become more aware of data visualizations in the news and media and be able to evaluate and critique them. I believe having these skills is vital in today's technologically-focused world, and can help me excel at my current job as well as futute jobs to come.

### Week 2 OIG Data Visualization 1

Newspaper Journalist: I created my visualizations for the newspaper as if it were focusing on the status and conditions of the children and families in the Border Patrol facilities. While this would mainly be just an informative article, it would lean toward supporting the idea that the facilities are failing by becoming overcrowded by increased numbers of those apprehended and the inability to transfer them to which is leading to prolonged stays. I chose to do a bar chart showing the increase in Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units, compaing the FY' 18 and FY'19 side by side.I included the numbers of each, and the percent increase of Family Units in the desription. I thought this was enough information with the visual to get the point across that there was a large increase in apprehensions. 
My second infographic was a pictorial chart to show the percentage of children detained for more than 72 hours. This is a simple way to show a statistic that is also eye-appealing in an article, rather than another chart or numbers.
For both visuals I used minimum colors, and kept to the red/heat colors to depict negative (or bad) information.
