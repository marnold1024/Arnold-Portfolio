# Arnold-Portfolio
This portfolio will hold my work for my Telling Stories with Data course.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Megan (pronouns: she, her). I'm in my second semester of the Master of Public Management program and am hoping to graduate in 2021. 
I currently work for CMU at the Software Engineering Institute. I'm part of the Transition Services team, assisting with the course administration and logistics of the professional development courses offered on software architecture and insider threat to our internal and external clients locally and internationally. While my future after graduation is unclear, I hope to either still be employed by CMU or get a job at a nonprofit focusing on community development.

## What I hope to learn
I'm very excited about this course, as it is the first of this kind for me, so I know I will get a lot out of it. I'm interested in being able to show data in a visually pleasing and effective manner. I'm also excited to become more aware of data visualizations in the news and media and be able to evaluate and critique them. I believe having these skills is vital in today's technologically-focused world, and can help me excel at my current job as well as futute jobs to come.
