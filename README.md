# Arnold-Portfolio
This portfolio will hold my work for my Telling Stories with Data course.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Megan (pronouns: she, her). I'm in my second semester of the Master of Public Management program and am hoping to graduate in 2021. 
I currently work for CMU at the Software Engineering Institute. I'm part of the Transition Services team, assisting with the course administration and logistics of the professional development courses offered on software architecture and insider threat to our internal and external clients locally and internationally. While my future after graduation is unclear, I hope to either still be employed by CMU or get a job at a nonprofit focusing on community development.

## What I hope to learn
I'm very excited about this course, as it is the first of this kind for me, so I know I will get a lot out of it. I'm interested in being able to show data in a visually pleasing and effective manner. I'm also excited to become more aware of data visualizations in the news and media and be able to evaluate and critique them. I believe having these skills is vital in today's technologically-focused world, and can help me excel at my current job as well as futute jobs to come.

### Week 2 OIG Data Visualization 1

For both visual categories, I used the Infogram Checklist when creating my charts. I particularly tried to focus on the "Can you understand the visualization in under 30 seconds" and "Did you pick the right chart type?". I tried many different charts using the data, until I found the ones that made the most sense for the data and story I wanted to portray to both audiences. 

Newspaper Journalist: I created my visualizations for the newspaper as if it were focusing on the status and conditions of the children and families in the Border Patrol facilities. While this would mainly be just an informative article, it would lean toward supporting the idea that the facilities are failing by becoming overcrowded by increased numbers of those apprehended and the inability to transfer them to which is leading to prolonged stays. I chose to do a bar chart showing the increase in Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units, compaing the FY' 18 and FY'19 side by side.I included the numbers of each, and the percent increase of Family Units in the desription. I thought this was enough information with the visual to get the point across that there was a large increase in apprehensions. 
My second infographic was a pictorial chart to show the percentage of children detained for more than 72 hours. This is a simple way to show a statistic that is also eye-appealing in an article, rather than another chart or numbers.
For both visuals I used minimum colors, and kept to the red/heat colors to depict negative (or bad) information.

DHS Analyst: For the visuals created to be in the report itself, I tried to take a more statistical, straighforward view- just creating visuals for the data given. I chose to create a grouped bar chart using the first table to statistics to show the increases in apprehensions for each group of people. I provided the numbers as well as the percentages, since the audience includes analysts and others with statistical backgrounds. I also included a pie chart to display the information about how long people were being detained, since the ICE and HHS facilities were at capacity. Again for both charts, I stuck with the red/hot colors, as well as gray. The first chart uses gray to put the attention on the current year stats and not 2018. The pie chart puts focus on the percentages of people detained longer than the TEDS standards.

### Week 2 Data Visualization Critique 2

The original data visualization can be found at: (https://abcnews.go.com/US/shark-attacks-told-graphs/story?id=31779076)
It is the map titled "US Experiences Largest Amount of Shark Attacks". When using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effective Profile to evaluate the visualization, I generally gave each category a score above 5. I however, still thought the data could be shown in a different way to be more effective. The audience of the article in which the graphic was found would be anyone searching about shark attacks and wanting to learn about them. That being said, I thought the map data visualization was pretty useful, in that it didn't have to be too in depth. While most people could recognize that the visual was of a world map, where the numbers were placed did not allow them to be read easily. It was difficult to be sure I read every number that was provided. I do think this type of visualization is nice for a general informative article, as pictures are more fun and pleasing to look at than graphs, but to provide this data in a graph would actually make it easier to tell which countries has the most attacks compared to others. 
I chose to show this data in a bar graph, with the countries with the most attacks at the top and the least at the bottom. This allows the reader to easily see the countries in order, compared to having to search around the map and remember which numbers they already read to determine the order. I kept all of the bars the same color, as the different sizes of the bars and value numbers are enough to fully understand the order of most shark attacks around the world.
